 Diffusion-weighted MRI images acquired with multiple b-values have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy by increasing the conspicuity of lesions and inflammatory activity with background suppression. Unfortunately, the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of DW-MRI reduces enthusiasm for using these images for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, lengthy acquisition times limit our ability to improve the quality of multi b-value DW-MRI images by multiple excitations acquisition and signal averaging at each b-value. To offset these limitations, we propose the Simultaneous Model Estimation and Image Reconstruction (SMEIR) for DW-MRI, which substantially improves the quality of multi b-value DW-MRI images without increasing acquisition times. Our model introduces the physiological signal decay model of DW-MRI as a constraint in the reconstruction of the DW-MRI images. An in-vivo
