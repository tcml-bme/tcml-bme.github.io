 This paper present a novel image-guided system for precise automatic targeting in keyhole minimally invasive neurosurgery. The system consists of a miniature robot fitted with a mechanical guide for needle/probe insertion. Intraoperatively, the robot is directly affixed to a head clamp or to the patient skull. It automatically positions itself with respect to predefined targets in a preoperative CT/MRI image following an anatomical registration with a intraoperative 3D surface scan of the patient facial features. We describe the preoperative planning and registration modules, and an in-vitro registration experiment of the entire system which yields a target registration error of 1.7mm (std=0.7mm).
