 Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Cardiac MDCT scan generally allows for reconstruction of several frames/phases in the cardiac cycle. The reconstructed images are then used to create curved multi-planar reformation (MPR) views wherein coronary lesions are best diagnosed. However, the generation of such MPR views for all potentially reconstructed phases is tedious and time consuming. Therefore, only a single phase is commonly used for diagnosis which may reduce the overall diagnostic accuracy. In the current work, we propose a new method that enable diagnosis of lesions from all reconstructed phases on a common MPR view simultaneously. Our method extracts the coronary centerline in one phase only. Next, it performs a fast registration of a region of interest between the multiple phases
