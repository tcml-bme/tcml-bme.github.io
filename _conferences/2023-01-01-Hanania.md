 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image registration can be used to enable free-breathing  mapping. Yet, inherent intensity differences between the different time points make the registration task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing  mapping. We incorporate the signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches
