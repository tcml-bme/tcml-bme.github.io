Tumor development is clinically characterized through the manual review of histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSI). However, the molecular attributes influencing tumor morphology are not entirely comprehended. Here, we present RNALerner, an innovative tool designed to expedite the identification of correlations between gene expression and tumor morphology as presented in H&E WSI. RNALerner achieves its efficiency by transforming the problem from linear regression to binary classification of high versus low RNA levels, and the use of Resnet18, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Furthermore, the training phase of the model is halted after only 3 iterations. Upon comparing our results with previous work, we discovered a similar number of statistically significant correlated genes but with a reduction in the number of model parameters and processing time.
