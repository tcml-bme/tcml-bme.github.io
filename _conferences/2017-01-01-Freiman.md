 We introduce a functional for the learning of an optimal database for patch-based image segmentation with application to coronary lumen segmentation from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data. The proposed functional consists of fidelity, sparseness and robustness to small-variations terms and their associated weights. Existing work address database optimization by prototype selection aiming to optimize the database by either adding or removing prototypes according to a set of predefined rules. In contrast, we formulate the database optimization task as an energy minimization problem that can be solved using standard numerical tools. We apply the proposed database optimization functional to the task of optimizing a database for patch-base coronary lumen segmentation. Our experiments using the publicly available MICCAI 2012 coronary lumen segmentation challenge data
