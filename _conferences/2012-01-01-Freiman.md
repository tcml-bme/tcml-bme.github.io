 Abdominal image non-rigid registration is a particularly challenging task due to the presence of multiple organs, many of which move independently, contributing to independent deformations. Local-affine registration methods can handle multiple independent movements by assigning prior definition of each affine component and its spatial extent which is less suitable for multiple soft-tissue structures as in the abdomen. Instead, we propose to use the local-affine assumption as a prior constraint within the dense deformation field computation. Our method use the dense correspondences field computed using the optical-flow equations to estimate the local-affine transformations that best represent the deformation associated with each voxel with Gaussian regularization to ensure the smoothness of the deformation field.
