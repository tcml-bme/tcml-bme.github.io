Numerous deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been proposed in recent years to tackle the challenging ill-posed inverse problem of MRI reconstruction from undersampled k-space (Fourier domain) data. However, these methods have shown instability when faced with variations in the acquisition process and anatomical distribution. This instability indicates that DNN architectures have poorer generalization compared to their classical counterparts in capturing the relevant physical models. Consequently, the limited generalization hinders the applicability of DNNs for undersampled MRI reconstruction in the clinical setting, which is especially critical in detecting subtle pathological regions that play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. We enhance the generalization capacity of deep neural network (DNN) methods for undersampled MRI reconstruction by introducing a physically-primed DNN architecture
