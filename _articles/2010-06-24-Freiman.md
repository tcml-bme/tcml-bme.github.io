 Objective We present a method and a validation study for the nearly automatic segmentation of liver tumors in CTA scans. Materials and methods Our method inputs a liver CTA scan and a small number of user-defined seeds. It first classifies the liver voxels into tumor and healthy tissue classes with an SVM classification engine from which a new set of high- quality seeds is generated. Next, an energy function describing the propagation of these seeds is defined over the 3D image. The functional consists of a set of linear equations that are optimized with the conjugate gradients method. The result is a continuous segmentation map that is thresholded to obtain a binary segmentation. Results A retrospective study on a validated clinical dataset consisting of 20 tumors from nine patients CTA scans from the MICCAI08 3D
