Diffusion-weighted MRI has the potential to provide important new insights into physiological and microstructural properties of the body. The Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model relates the observed DW-MRI signal decay to parameters that reflect blood flow in the capillaries (D), capillaries volume fraction (f), and diffusivity (D). However, the commonly used, independent voxel-wise fitting of the IVIM model leads to imprecise parameter estimates, which has hampered their practical usage. In this work, we improve the precision of estimates by introducing a spatially-constrained Incoherent Motion (IM) model of DW-MRI signal decay. We also introduce an efficient iterative fusion bootstrap moves (FBM) solver that enables precise parameter estimates with this new IM model. This solver updates parameter estimates by applying a binary graph-cut solver to fuse the current estimate of parameter values with a
