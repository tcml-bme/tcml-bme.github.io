Quantification of uncertainty in deep-neural-networks (DNN) based image registration algorithms plays a critical role in the deployment of image registration algorithms for clinical applications such as surgical planning, intraoperative guidance, and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression or treatment efficacy as well as in research-oriented processing pipelines. Currently available approaches for uncertainty estimation in DNN-based image registration algorithms may result in sub-optimal clinical decision making due to potentially inaccurate estimation of the uncertainty of the registration stems for the assumed parametric distribution of the registration latent space. We introduce NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian framework for uncertainty estimation in DNN-based deformable image registration by combining an Adam optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to characterize the
