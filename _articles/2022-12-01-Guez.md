Abstract Background and Objective: Recurrent attentive non-invasive observation of intestinal inflammation is essential for the proper management of Crohns disease (CD). The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate a multi-modal machine-learning (ML) model to assess ileal CD endoscopic activity by integrating information from Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) and biochemical biomarkers. Methods: We obtained MRE, biochemical and ileocolonoscopy data from the multi-center ImageKids study database. We developed an optimized multimodal fusion ML model to non-invasively assess terminal ileum (TI) endoscopic disease activity in CD from MRE data. We determined the most informative features for model development using a permutation feature importance technique. We assessed model performance in comparison to the clinically recommended linear-regression MRE model in an
