BackgroundPericoronary adipose tissue CT-attenuation (PCATa) has been demonstrated to assess coronary specific inflammation and is of prognostic value in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). We assessed the prognostic value of PCATa beyond quantitative coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-derived plaque volume and positron emission tomography (PET) determined ischemia.Methods539 patients who underwent CCTA and [15 O] H 2 O PET perfusion imaging because of suspected CAD were included. Imaging assessment included coronary artery calcium score (CACS), presence of obstructive CAD ( 50% stenosis) and high-risk plaques (HRP), total plaque volume (TPV), calcified/noncalcified plaque volume (CPV/NCPV), PCATa, and presence of myocardial ischemia. The endpoint was a composite of death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI). Prognostic
