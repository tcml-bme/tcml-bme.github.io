Background and objectiveHigh-quality reconstruction of MRI images from under-sampled k-space data, which is in the Fourier domain, is crucial for shortening MRI acquisition times and ensuring superior temporal resolution. Over recent years, a wealth of deep neural network (DNN) methods have emerged, aiming to tackle the complex, ill-posed inverse problem linked to this process. However, their instability against variations in the acquisition process and anatomical distribution exposes a deficiency in the generalization of relevant physical models within these DNN architectures. The goal of our work is to enhance the generalization capabilities of DNN methods for k-space interpolation by introducing MA-RECON, an innovative mask-aware DNN architecture and associated training method.MethodsUnlike preceding approaches, our MA-RECON architecture encodes not only the observed data but also the
