 Purpose To implement and evaluate the performance of a computerized statistical tool designed for robust and quantitative analysis of hemodynamic response imaging (HRI) derived maps for the early identification of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Materials and Methods CRLMbearing mice were scanned during the early stage of tumor growth and subsequently during the advancedstage. Three experienced radiologists marked various suspectedfoci on the early stage anatomical images and classified each as either highly certain or as suspected tumors. The statistical model construction was based on HRI maps (functionalMRI combined with hypercapnia and hyperoxia) using a supervised learning paradigm which was further trained either with the advancedstage sets (late training; LT) or with the early stage sets (early training; ET). For each group of foci, the classifier results were compared with the
