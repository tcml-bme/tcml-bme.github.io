 Purpose We present a new algorithm for nearly automatic liver segmentation and volume estimation from abdominal Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images and its validation. Materials and methods Our hybrid algorithm uses a multiresolution iterative scheme. It starts from a single user-defined pixel seed inside the liver, and repeatedly applies smoothed Bayesian classification to identify the liver and other organs, followed by adaptive morphological operations and active contours refinement. We evaluate the algorithm with two retrospective studies on 56 validated CTA images. The first study compares it to ground-truth manual segmentation and semi-automatic and automatic commercial methods. The second study uses the public data-set SLIVER07 and its comparison methodology. Results We achieved
