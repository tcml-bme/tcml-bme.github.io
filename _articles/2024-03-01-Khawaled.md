The ability to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled MRI data is vital in improving MRI temporal resolution and reducing acquisition times. Deep learning methods have been proposed for this task, but the lack of verified methods to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed images hampered clinical applicability. We introduce NPB-REC, a non-parametric fully Bayesian framework, for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data with uncertainty estimation. We use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics during training to characterize the posterior distribution of the network parameters. This enables us to both improve the quality of the reconstructed images and quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed images. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a multi-coil MRI dataset from the fastMRI challenge and compare it to the baseline End-to-End Variational Network (E2E-VarNet). Our
