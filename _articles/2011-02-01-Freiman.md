We present a new non-uniform sampling method for the accurate estimation of mutual information in multi-modal brain image rigid registration. Most existing density estimators used for mutual information computation incorrectly assume that the intensity of each voxel is independent from its neighborhood. Our method uses the 3D Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform to reduce the sampled voxels interdependency by sampling voxels that are less dependent on their neighborhood, and thus provide a more accurate estimation of the mutual information and a more accurate registration. The main advantages of our method over other non-uniform sampling schemes are that: (1) it provides more accurate estimation of the image statistics with fewer samples; (2) it is less sensitive to the variability of anatomical structures shapes, orientations, and sizes, and; (3) it yields more accurate registration results.
