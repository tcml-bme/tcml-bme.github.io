Introduction For supervised deep learning (DL) tasks, researchers need a large annotated dataset. In medical data science, one of the major limitations to develop DL models is the lack of annotated examples in large quantity. This is most often due to the time and expertise required to annotate. We introduce Lirot.ai, a novel platform for facilitating and crowd-sourcing image segmentations. Methods Lirot.ai is composed of three components; an iPadOS client application named Lirot.ai-app, a back-end server named Lirot.ai-server and a python API name Lirot.ai-API. Lirot.ai-app was developed in Swift 5.6 and Lirot.ai-server is a firebase backend. Lirot.ai-API allows the management of the database. Lirot.ai-app can be installed on as many iPadOS devices as needed so that annotators may be able to perform their segmentation simultaneously and remotely. We incorporate Apple Pencil compatibility, making the
