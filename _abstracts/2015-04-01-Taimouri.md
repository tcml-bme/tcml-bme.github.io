Diffusivity of water molecules estimated from diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is an important biomarker to pinpoint regions with restricted diffusion such as inflamed bowel regions in patients with Crohn's Disease (CD). There is a need to fuse the information extracted from DW-MRI with other image modalities, e.g. structural T1w images, for more accurate and efficient diagnosis. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio, distortion and lower resolution of DW-MR images compared to T1w images, fusion of these image modalities is challenging, especially in turns and folds of the bowel. This paper presents a novel method to register structural T1w and diffusion weighted images, which facilitates the image fusion. Based on the block-matching algorithm, the proposed method first determines multiple candidate matches in a neighborhood, and then iteratively finds the most probable match using additional geometric
