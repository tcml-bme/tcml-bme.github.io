Predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is crucial for effective surgical planning and treatment optimization. While radiomics-based methods have been explored for pCR prediction using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), they rely on manual tumor segmentationa laborious and error-prone task. Our study introduces a deep learning model that automates tumor segmentation from DWI, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of radiomics-based pCR predictions and eliminating the need for manual intervention. We evaluated our approach on the publicly BMMR2 challenge data using a k-fold crossvalidation experimental setup, comparing the radiomics-based pCR predictions from manual and automatic segmentations. Our approach demonstrated a human-level performance for pre-treatment radiomics-based pCR prediction from the DWI data.Clinical
