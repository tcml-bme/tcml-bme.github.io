We present a new variational-based method for automatic liver vessels segmentation from abdominal CTA images. The segmentation task is formulated as a functional minimization problem within a variational framework. We introduce a new functional that incorporates both geometrical vesselness measure and vessels surface properties. The functional describes the distance between the desired segmentation and the original image. To minimize the functional, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation from it and solve it using the conjugate gradients algorithm. Our approach is automatic and improves upon other Hessian-based methods in the detection of bifurcations and complex vessels structures by incorporating a surface term into the functional. To assess our method, we conducted with an expert radiologist two comparative studies on 8 abdominal CTA clinical datasets. In the first study, the radiologist assessed
