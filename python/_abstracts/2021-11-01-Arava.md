Myocardial T 1  mapping is a cardiac MRI technique, used to assess myocardial fibrosis. In this technique, a series of T 1 -weighted MRI images are acquired with different saturation or inversion times. These images are fitted to the T 1  model to estimate the model parameters and construct the desired T 1  maps. In the presence of motion, the different T 1 -weighted images are not aligned. This, in turn, will cause errors and inaccuracies in the final estimation of the T 1  maps. Therefore, motion correction is a necessary process for myocardial T 1  mapping. We present a deep-learning (DL) based system for cardiac T 1 weighted MRI images motion correction. When applying our DL-based motion correction system we achieve a statistically significant improved performance by means of R 2  of the model fitting regression, in compared to the model fitting regression without motion correction (0.52 vs 0.29, p<0.05).
