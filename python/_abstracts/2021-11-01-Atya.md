Automatic brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data plays an important role in assessing tumor response to therapy and personalized treatment stratification. Manual segmentation is tedious and subjective. Deep-learning based algorithms for brain tumor segmentation have the potential to provide objective and fast tumor segmentation. However, the training of such algorithms requires large datasets which are not always available. Data augmentation techniques may reduce the need for large datasets. However current approaches are mostly parametric and may result in suboptimal performance. We introduce two non-parametric methods of data augmentation for brain tumor segmentation: the mixed structure regularization (MSR) and shuffle pixels noise (SPN). We evaluated the added value of the MSR and SPN augmentation on the brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) 2018
