We present a novel non-invasive automatic method for the classification and grading of liver fibrosis from fMRI maps based on hepatic hemodynamic changes. This method automatically creates a model for liver fibrosis grading based on training datasets. Our supervised learning method evaluates hepatic hemodynamics from an anatomical MRI image and three T2*-W fMRI signal intensity time-course scans acquired during the breathing of air, air-carbon dioxide, and carbogen. It constructs a statistical model of liver fibrosis from these fMRI scans using a binary-based one-against-all multi class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We evaluated the resulting classification model with the leave-one out technique and compared it to both full multi-class SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifications. Our experimental study analyzed 57 slice sets from 13 mice, and yielded a 98.2% separation accuracy
