<jats:p>Recently, unsupervised deep-learning showed improved performance in estimating the &amp;ldquo;Intra-Voxel incoherent motion&amp;rdquo; (IVIM) signal decay model parameters from Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) data compared to classical methods. However, such deep-learning models do not generalize well on acquisitions with a high signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this work, we introduce SUPER-IVIM-DC, a supervised deep learning network coupled with a data consistency term to improve the capacity of deep-learning-based models to generalize the IVIM signal decay model. We demonstrated an improvement in model generalization, accuracy, and homogeneity using simulation, phantom, and in-vivo experiments. </jats:p>
