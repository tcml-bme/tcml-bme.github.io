Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) based indices are used to assess the severity of Crohns disease (CD) in patients. Manual calculation of these indices by radiologists is both time consuming and subject to bias. Specifically, terminal-ileum (TI) wall-thickening is challenging to estimate, especially from gadolinium-free T2-weighted MRI data. We present a machine-learning-based system to automatically segment the TI and classify wall-thickening from T2-weighted MRE data. We introduce an anatomically-constrained U-net segmentation model to cope with the inherently heterogeneous appearance, large anatomical variability and limited availability of data for TI segmentation from MRE data. We evaluated the added-value of our anatomically-constrained segmentation model on 180 T2-weighted MRE scans collected as part of the ImageKids study using k-fold cross-validation experimental setup.
